I created well-structured test case and bug report templates in Jira, making it easier for QA teams to track issues efficiently. These templates follow industry best practices, ensuring clear steps, expected vs. actual results, severity levels, and reproducibility. 
My work has helped streamline testing processes and improve communication between testers and developers.
